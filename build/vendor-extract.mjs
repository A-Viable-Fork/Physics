// Role: the deterministic substrate extraction. Copies exactly the files named in
//   build/substrate-manifest.json from the pinned upstream/epistack submodule into vendor/,
//   byte for byte, creating directories as needed. This is the only path by which vendor/ content
//   is produced; vendor/ is never hand-edited.
// Contract: `node build/vendor-extract.mjs` reads the manifest, copies each file from
//   upstream/epistack/<path> to vendor/<path>, and reports what it wrote. Deterministic: the same
//   submodule commit and the same manifest always produce byte-identical vendor/ content.
// Invariant: this script performs no transformation on file content, only a copy. The two
//   deliberate divergences from upstream (docs/governing-conventions.md) are applied to vendor/
//   by a separate, named step after extraction, never silently folded in here.
